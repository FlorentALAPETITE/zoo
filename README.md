# Atlanmod Zoo


Atlanmod Zoo is a set of Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) Ecore models,
which can be easily integrated to projects that require these models.

Some examples of available models are:
- [Simple graph](./emf-graph/): A simple syntax for representing oriented
graphs (mostly used for testing purposes.
- [Java](./emf-java/): Java syntax model, used by the
[Modisco](https://www.eclipse.org/MoDisco/) tool)

This repository only contains models expressed in [Xcore](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Xcore).
The EMF underlying code is generated with the [Xtext Maven Plugin](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/350_continuous_integration.html).
